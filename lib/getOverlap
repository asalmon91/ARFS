function [ overlap ] = getOverlap( rf, cc, dim )
%getOverlap calculates the predicted percent overlap between ref. frame
%and opposing cluster composite images
%   rf and cc must be of the form [x y], and dim must be [height width]

dx = abs(rf(1) - cc(1));
dy = abs(rf(2) - cc(2));
xOL = dim(2) - dx;
yOL = dim(1) - dy;
if xOL < 0 || yOL < 0

else
    overlap = (xOL*yOL)/(prod(dim));
